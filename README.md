# 0CC-LLTracker

0CC-LLTracker is a modified version of 0CC-FamiTracker that incorporates the YM2413 (OPLL) FM soundchip. Some features include:

- Full percussion mode and custom patch support
- VGM and WAV export
  - VGM export is currently limited to looping the entire song, loop points set with `Bxx` are ignored.
- Many useful quality-of-life features inherited from 0CC-FamiTracker.
